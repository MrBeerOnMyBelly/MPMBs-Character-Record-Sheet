/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file. You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.
	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialogue.
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialogue.
	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded or reset sheet before adding any other information so that there won't be any conflicts.

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	(sub)race
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new (sub)race to the sheet.
				Note that you will need to define a race using this syntax once for every sub-race (i.e. there is a separate entry for High Elf, Wood Elf, and Dark Elf)
				You will use this for a race that doesn't have a subrace, like Dragonborn and also for a subrace of a race, like Hill Dwarf and Mountain Dwarf.
				You do not make a separate entry for the parent of a subrace. So there is no Dwarf or Elf entry!
				For races that have variants, like the human, you can define a variant using the RaceSubList. Any variant defined like that will only be selectable through the "Racial Options" button
	Sheet:		v13.00.00 (2018-??-??) [identical to v12.999 syntax, except v12.999 uses 'borrow' for the burrow speed]
